---
Manage and organise your tab the right way with Treely. Boost your productivity and focus on the important task. Tab management doesn't have to be a hassle.

Treely is built on the concept of managing tabs like a "tree". By default, any new tab opened from the current tab is organised as the "child" of the current branch and displayed beneath of the current tab in the menu. The children of the branch can be shown by toggling the arrow sign in front of the branch tab. It is useful for grouping tabs on similar topics as you're browsing the internet.
